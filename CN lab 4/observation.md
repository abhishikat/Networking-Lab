## Observations
- A toplogy was created using three Routers, two Switchs and two PC's connected to each switch using copper straight-through connections and serial DCE connections
- Assigning ip addresses(gateway) to routers using the same method that we used in last lab.
- Assigning static routes to router 1
- Viewing the routers ip routes using `show ip route`
