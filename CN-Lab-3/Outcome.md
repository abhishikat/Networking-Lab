# Configuring IP address to Routers in Packet Tracer and configuring static routes in multiple router topology<br>

        A toplogy was created using three Router-PT and two PC's connected to two routers using copper cross-over connections and serial DCE connections<br>
        Different default gateways were configured for both the PC's .<br>
        A unique IP address was configured for each PC.<br>
        IP address was configured for each interface using CLI<br>
        Pinging PC1 from PC0 gave destination host unreachable<br>
        ip routes for each router was viewed using the command: show ip route<br>
        Static ip route was configured for each router using CLI commands: ip route destination_network subnet_mask next_hop_address<br>





# Learning outcomes<br>
      -Creating a topology with multiple routers.<br>
      -Configuring default gateway and ip address.<br>
      -Configuring ip address for the interfaces<br>
      -Pinging gives destination host unreachable if the device networks are not directly connected
      -Configuring static ip routes<br>
      -On configuring the static ip routes, pinging gives the required response<br>
