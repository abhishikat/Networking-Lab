# Creating a topology and simulating a simple PDU using hub and switch as connecting devices
        A toplogy was created using Hub-PT and Switch-PT as connecting devices and two PC's connected to hub and switch using copper straight-through and copper cross-over connections
        A default gateway was configured.
        A unique IP address was configured for each PC.
        An ICMP pa cket was transferred from source to destination via Hub and Switch as connecting devices
# Learning Outcomes
        Creating a topology.
        Configuring default gateway and ip address.
        Hub is a broadcasting device which forwards the packets to all the devices connected.
        Switch is an intelligent device which forwards the packets to only the intended destination.
        The device decision is to Encapsulate in layers 3 and 2 and Transmit in layer 1
